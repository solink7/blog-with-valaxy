**总文本 (Full Dialogue):**

**Student A:** Hey everyone. We'll all be looking for jobs soon after graduation.For me, the most important thing is definitely job satisfaction.I really want to do something I'm genuinely interested in, something I enjoy waking up for each day.That's my top priority.Because enjoying my work makes every day better.

**Student B:** That's a good point, A.But for me, earning enough money is also a very important factor.I want to have a comfortable lifestyle, you know, and maybe be able to support my family in the future.So, a decent salary is high on my list.It's just a practical consideration for the future, you know.

**Student C:**  I see your points. Money is important, for sure.But I also think it's great if a job allows me to make a positive impact.Maybe helping other people, or giving something back to society.That kind of fulfillment would mean a lot to me.It feels more meaningful than just working for a paycheck.

**Student D:** Those are all valid considerations.For me, I'd also look for opportunities to learn and grow professionally.A job where I can develop new skills and gain valuable experience would be ideal.I think that's crucial for long-term career development.It helps build a strong foundation for whatever comes next.
